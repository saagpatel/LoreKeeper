# LoreKeeper Internal Release Guide (macOS)

This guide defines the internal release contract for LoreKeeper on `main`, following the historical promotion to `master`.

## Release Scope

- Platform: macOS only
- Distribution posture: unsigned internal build
- Signing/notarization: intentionally out of scope for this release
- Default branch for promotion: `main`
- Historical internal release ref: `master @ dd1e8fb`
- Promotion source branch: `codex/fix/default-branch-risk-hardening`
- Candidate baseline before release-prep work: `42eed42`
- Fallback commit captured before release-prep promotion: `990bae4` (then `origin/master`)

Exact release commit SHA is recorded in the build manifest created by:

```bash
npm run release:internal:mac
```

The manifest is written to:

```text
release-artifacts/internal/macos/<version>-<shortsha>/release-manifest.json
```

## Branch Convergence

The merged internal release line already includes the branch work we needed for internal release:

- `codex/lean-dev-mode` -> included
- `codex/chore/bootstrap-codex-os` -> partially superseded by the merged internal release line; any remaining differences are deferred follow-up work
- `codex/build/default-branch-risk-hardening` -> included
- `codex/aggressive-prune-cleanup` -> included

The older open bootstrap PR line is not part of this release path. The merged internal release line is the source of truth for teammates and testers.

## Release Commands

Run these commands in order when preparing an internal candidate:

```bash
npm run version:check
npm run verify:internal-release
npm run release:internal:mac
```

What they do:

- `npm run version:check`: ensures version parity across `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `npm run verify:internal-release`: runs the canonical repo verification flow, then full correctness verification, then browser-level E2E
- `npm run release:internal:mac`: builds the unsigned macOS artifact, writes checksums, and writes a release manifest

## Artifact Contract

Internal release artifacts are written to:

```text
release-artifacts/internal/macos/<version>-<shortsha>/
```

That folder contains:

- final artifact files produced from the Tauri macOS bundle output
- `release-manifest.json`
- `checksums.txt`
- `BUILD_INFO.txt`

Preferred artifact:

- default Tauri macOS bundle output for the current app version

Accepted secondary outputs:

- any other macOS bundle file emitted by Tauri during the same build

## Current Release Highlights

Compared with the default branch fallback line, this internal release line adds:

- lean dev mode plus explicit cleanup commands
- canonical repo verification and CI/perf contract alignment
- repo-owned commit/perf tooling and guard scripts
- desktop hardening for modules, settings, themes, and save/load validation
- browser-level E2E coverage for the current validated flows

Compatibility note:

- New manual save names now use the stricter safe-label rules.
- Existing saves created before that hardening remain loadable, deletable, and overwriteable from the save list so internal users do not lose access to prior progress.

Required verification commands for every internal candidate:

```bash
bash .codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh
npm run verify:full
npm run test:e2e
npm run version:check
```

## Install and Run

1. Build or download the internal artifact directory.
2. Prefer the `.dmg` artifact if present.
3. If only the archived `.app` bundle is available:
   - extract the archive
   - move `LoreKeeper.app` into `/Applications` or another trusted local folder
4. Open the app normally.

If macOS Gatekeeper blocks launch because the build is unsigned:

1. Control-click the app and choose `Open`
2. If macOS still blocks it, remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LoreKeeper.app
```

3. Re-open the app

## Tester Charter

Validate these areas for the internal release:

- app launches successfully from the packaged build
- title screen loads without a blank window
- new game starts
- basic commands work: `look`, movement, inventory/help
- settings open and close cleanly
- save/load works
- quick save works
- theme change applies
- theme creator can save and load a valid theme
- invalid save names are rejected cleanly
- modules, stats, achievements, and replay screens open
- app works with Ollama disabled
- existing saves/settings do not crash the app

Do not block this internal release on:

- signing or notarization
- public-distribution polish
- non-macOS platforms
- updater/distribution automation beyond artifact generation

## Known Issues

- The internal macOS build is unsigned, so Gatekeeper may prompt on first launch.
- Internal release verification relies on the existing browser E2E harness plus local packaged-build smoke. There is no repo-owned fully automated GUI test harness for the packaged Tauri app yet.
- Ollama remains optional and local-only by design. Internal release validation should not treat unavailable Ollama as a blocker if the fallback narration path works.
- The manual internal macOS GitHub workflow installs the Playwright browser before verification; if that step ever drifts, the workflow will fail before artifact creation rather than producing a weak release signal.
- One medium Rust dependency advisory remains open in the transitive GTK/Tauri desktop stack (`glib`). A dry-run attempt to bump directly to `0.20.0` fails because the current Tauri GTK line requires `glib ^0.18`, so this remains an upstream-compatible follow-up rather than an internal-release blocker.
- Tauri warns that the bundle identifier `com.lorekeeper.app` ends with `.app`. The current build still succeeds, but that identifier should be corrected before public distribution if we plan any data-path migration carefully.

## Reporting and Triage

When reporting an internal release issue, include:

- artifact version
- commit SHA from `release-manifest.json`
- the exact artifact file used
- reproduction steps
- whether the issue happens in packaged mode only or also in `tauri dev`

Treat these as release blockers:

- packaged app fails to launch
- blank window or missing frontend assets
- save/load breaks
- clear data-loss risk
- any known P0/P1 regression in the verified core flows

## Rollback

Rollback target for this internal release line:

```text
990bae4
```

If the internal candidate is rejected, fall back to that ref and re-run the internal release verification set before distributing another artifact.
